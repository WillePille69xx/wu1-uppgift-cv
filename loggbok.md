# Loggbok för CV

Här skriver jag en planering för mitt CV.
Sedan skriver jag kring mitt arbete och hur det gick.

Skriv en kort planering först.

## Planering
I have planed to do a side bar and have my logo in the top left corner where I'll also have a fixed nav bar maybe som information there as well... Now I've made a physical skis of how it will look. So basically this first lesson I haven't really done much except for the skis and thought about how to make it look better. Next lesson I will start programming the the main page and maybe if I am fast enough I might also be able to make the navbar.

2024-10-15: Ok I've forgotten to push-it to github as well as update this log but here's a rundown on what I've done. I tried to make a sidebar but ran into many problems so I basically decided to start over and right now I have problems with the sidebar covering the main container so anything I wrote in the main got mostly covered by the sidebar... lol Now that i think of it although my code looks way better now I have literally the same problem that made me redo my code. If you read my css you'll probably notice I love comments srry if it makes it harder to read. // overwhelms you.

2024-10-16: OK I've done a lot however the problem is that he fucking site looks ugly as fuck. And I'm to
tired to try and fix it I've been working since 8:00 and the clock is now almost 12 so 4 hours trying to fix it but not much success.

2024-10-23: OK I Am Dumb. Absolutely stupid.
I finally figured out why my code did'nt work. I've been so stupid considering I reset and started over 3 times because i just thought i was garbage at coding but the problem was that I Am garbage at coding but i mean the problem is that I've been forgetting that to link it to my style.css I first have to link it to its folder so yea I'm stupid. Massive facepalm moment when i realized it. -_- Honestly It's such a stupid mistake I can't believe I overlooked. I mean I checked the link between the codes several times yet still missed it.

Anyways I've taken back one of my old codes that I deleted because it did'nt work and now its working. 

Sedan kan du skriva i loggform om vad du har arbetat med från planering och hur det har gått att arbeta med.

Skriv även sådant som du måste arbeta med nästa pass.
