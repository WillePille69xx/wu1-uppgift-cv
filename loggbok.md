# Loggbok för CV

Här skriver jag en planering för mitt CV.
Sedan skriver jag kring mitt arbete och hur det gick.

Skriv en kort planering först.

## Planering
I have planed to do a side bar and have my logo in the top left corner where I'll also have a fixed nav bar maybe som information there as well... Now I've made a physical skis of how it will look. So basically this first lesson I haven't really done much except for the skis and thought about how to make it look better. Next lesson I will start programming the the main page and maybe if I am fast enough I might also be able to make the navbar.

2024-10-15: Ok I've forgotten to push-it to github as well as update this log but here's a rundown on what I've done. I tried to make a sidebar but ran into many problems so I basically decided to start over and right now I have problems with the sidebar covering the main container so anything I wrote in the main got mostly covered by the sidebar... lol Now that i think of it although my code looks way better now I have literally the same problem that made me redo my code. If you read my css you'll probably notice I love comments srry if it makes it harder to read. // overwhelms you.

2024-10-16: OK I've done a lot however the problem is that he fucking site looks ugly as fuck. And I'm to
tired to try and fix it I've been working since 8:00 and the clock is now almost 12 so 4 hours trying to fix it but not much success.
